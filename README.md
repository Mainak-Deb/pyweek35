# pyweek35
Team submission for pyweek35, repo will be renamed once we have a name for the game


# What goes here?
Include a README file in all your packages. This is the perfect place to explain:

* What dependencies your game requires to run
* How to build and run your game
* The controls
* What there is to see in the game
* Copyright attributions (eg. CC-BY resources you have used)

# Guidelines
* Work in the `dev` branch before merging into the `main`
* Rebase your work before pushing, try to keep the git history clean
* Don't push directly to any branch, do a PR
